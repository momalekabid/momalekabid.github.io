## the word parallelism 
recently, my sister was visiting me in waterloo, ontario,
for about a week before my convocation. after about two days together, she banned me from using the word "parallelism" due to alleged overuse. Okay, I get it -- I'm a computer scientist, and while I didn't think we used the expression THAT often, I managed to avoid the word up until I found myself sitting in PAC (Physical Activities Complex @ UWaterloo, a.k.a where the exams are taken and the conferring of degrees happens on convocation day), waiting for the graduate students to finish walking across the stage so I could get my *piece of paper* // *diploma*. After a while they started conferring the degrees in batches of three. My friend Justin, also a soon-to-be waterloo computer science graduate, turned to me and let out a restless sigh --
**"finally, some parallelism"**.


we know that Amdahl's Law:

$$ S(n) = \frac{1}{(1-p) + \frac{p}{n}} $$

tells us how much performance we get from parallelizing p % of n tasks. 
I'm still figuring out if that's how this multi-tasking thing works in real life, though. One way that question haunted me is my attempts to get my site off the ground; I've been trying to get a post out for a while, but this is the first proper one, and that's partially because I needed a bit more time to get used to the idea of doing certain things (work, research, writing) in parallel. i don't really have a choice, otherwise, nothing will get done.
I wrote this post in parallel while editing some other info; also, I remembered that I'm reading a couple of books in parallel, so let me list those, too. I can't promise that my future posts won't have the word parallel in them, but it definitely won't be nearly as bad as this one.

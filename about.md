   i graduated from uwaterloo in october '24, where i studied computer and cognitive science.
   originally, i wanted to make video games, but as a writer, i got into philosophy of language, linguistics, and then finally NLP in my first year of university. after that, i was 
   researching speech recognition @ cisco, then worked on LLMs @ datamuse.
    currently researching hdc/cv @ uwaterloo's centre for theoretical neuroscience in my free time, and working on models and infra to support our next-gen design tool @ Ficra (YC S24).

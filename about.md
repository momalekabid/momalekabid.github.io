   i graduated from uwaterloo in october '24, where i studied computer and cognitive science.
   originally, i wanted to make video games, but as a writer, i got into philosophy of language, linguistics, and then finally NLP in my first year of university. after that, i was 
   researching speech recognition @ cisco, then worked on LLMs @ datamuse.
    currently researching hdc/cv @ uwaterloo's centre for theoretical neuroscience in my free time, and doing a (thesis-based) masters in neural computation @ ethz. in industry i waws last working on building systems with embeddings + infra to support the next-gen `cursor for designers` @ Ficra (YC S24).
